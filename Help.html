    <h1>Colorado Accident Explorer Help</h1>

       <!--Put collaboration text here
      The CO Accident Explorer is a collaborative effort between CAIC and the Colorado Mountain College GIS program. CMC GIS alumni Lucy Kepner and Joe Tayabji designed and coded the application, advised by CMC GIS professor Dara Seidl. The map application is built in the open-source JavaScript <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library with charts coded in <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js</a> and <a href="https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/">dc.js</a>. The application is intended to provide CMC staff and the public a dynamic means to visualize accident statistics and their geographical distributions according to variables of interest, including avalanche aspect, relationship to treeline, month, and travel mode. The application is updated automatically from the List Observation Reports endpoint of the CAIC Data API.

    <h2>Accidents</h2>
    <p>Avalanche accidents occur when there is human involvement with an avalanche.  <!-- Condense sentences: ex. Either a human was caught, buried, or killed in the avalanche, or a human triggered the avalanche.-->This can mean someone was caught, buried, or killed. It can also mean there was a human triggered avalanche where no one was caught, buried, or killed. Accident statistics portrayed in this application date back to December 2009. Currently, only fatal accidents where at least one death occurred are depicted in the map. For more information, go to <a href="https://avalanche.state.co.us/accidents/statistics-and-reporting">CAIC Statistics & Reporting</a>.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>This map is a collaborative effort between the CAIC and Colorado Mountain College.  Lucy Kepner, Dara Seidl, and Joe Tayabji created the map using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, based on data provided from the CAIC. Accidents are shown on a map with three different base layers. <!-- Base layer descriptions can go under Layers --> The default, Natural Atlas, blends natural and man-made features with contour lines. Roads, trails, and peak names are all labeled. More detail is showed when zoomed in. The Imagery basemap displays satellite imagery from summer. When zoomed in, higher resolution imagery is shown. The Esri Terrain basemap is a simple layer that uses shaded relief so hills and mountains can easily be seen.</p>

    <h2>Layers</h2>
    <!-- List each layer and include the legend image -->
    <p>The default layer is the Accidents layer. Accident points are mapped, with D scale being indicated by color and R scale by circle size. The Accidents by Travel Mode layer shows the activity of the user(s) involved in the activity. The CAIC Zones layer shows the areas that forecasting is available for (https://lb.avalanche.state.co.us/forecasts/help/forecast-zones/). The Heatmap layer shows where accidents are focused. <!-- Include text that this is a representation of the density of the accident points.--> This layer adjusts based on how zoomed in the map is.</p>

    <h2>Map Buttons</h2>
    <!-- Center the images of the map buttons
    Placement of these buttons is going to change. -->
    <p style="display:inline-block;"><img src="images/dateFilter.png" style="height: 10%; width: 10%"></img>By default, the map loads with the previous 5 Water Years of data (one year is October 1 - September 30). This can be adjusted by clicking/tapping the dropdown with the calendar and date range. <br><br>
    <img src="images/zoomButton.png"><img>The + and - buttons can be used to control the zoom of the map. The Home button will take you to the default center and zoom of the map.<br><br> 
    <i class="fa fa-filter-circle-xmark"></i> Underneath that is the Clear Filters button, which will reset the data selection the the default data range and remove any filters from the graphs. Use this button to bring the original dataset back.<br><br>
    <img src="images/lasso.svg" style="width: 20px; height: auto"></img> Below this is the Lasso tool. With this selected, you can click, hold, and move your mouse on the map to select specific accident data. <br><br>
    <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i> At the bottom of these buttons is the help button. </p>

    <h2>Charts</h2>
    <!-- List each chart and include images-->
    <p>The map includes charts that change based on the data that is selected. The charts can be used to filter the map, as well. Click on any of the bars to only select data in that category. The filters are stackable, i.e. multiple charts can be used to filter. </p>

     <!-- Possibly take users through 1-2 scenarios, such as isolating accidents in the last avalanche year, then lassoing in a zone, then selecting from those the skiing ones. -->
