    <h1>Avalanche Accident Explorer</h1>

    The Avalanche Accident Explorer is a collaborative effort between the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) and Colorado Mountain College (CMC) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. CMC GIS alumni Lucy Kepner and Joe Tayabji designed and coded the application, advised by CMC GIS professor Dara Seidl and in conjunction with staff at CAIC. The application is intended to provide CAIC staff and the public a dynamic means to visualize accident statistics and their geographical distributions according to variables of interest, including avalanche aspect, relationship to treeline, travel mode, avalanche type, and month/year. The application is updated automatically from the List Observation Reports endpoint of the CAIC Data API.

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    The primary goal of this application is to promote safety in the backcountry. By equipping users to explore accident statistics in an interactive interface, we intend for our audience to become more familiar with the possibilities for danger when heading out for recreation.
    Accidents, especially fatal accidents, are sensitive data. Care has been taken to communicate these incidents respectfully.
